features:
  - title: Facilitate Access with Web-UIs
    details: Websites give users <em>and</em> developers great experiences.  Let's build interfaces there, and serve our early users better.
  - title: Master Tests for Lasting Success
    details: Writing automated tests is especially tricky in embedded systems - there are pitfalls that can make tests more cost than benefit.  A focus on testable architectures is the secret sauce.
  - title: Be Friends with the Hardware
    details: Simulation is great, but it only takes you so far.  Let's go boldly into hardware testing with robust protections and data-capture tools.
